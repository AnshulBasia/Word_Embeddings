In this project, I'll be focussing on applications of Word Embeddings and how can it be used to solve various problems, one by one. I feel that, we have pre-trained models 
from approaches like word2vec and glove and there's no point in cometing with them, rather, I plan to use them creatively to solve problems.

1.) Goal is to complet phrase like:
-> man is to king is like woman is to ___?(queen)

Sounds interesting ? Let's see if we can do that.
